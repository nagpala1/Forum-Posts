Paul George is a great player, but in what way did he 'challenge' Lebron this year other than having 3 great scoring outbursts in the playoffs? After all, his team got swept, and actually managed to blow a 25 point lead in one of those games.

 

The Pacers posed a challenge to Miami in 2012, 2013 and 2014, but that wasn't just because of the mighty, barely 6th best small-forward in the league. It was more-so because of the overall team effort of Indiana as opposed to one particular individual. The Pacers were a big and physical bunch and took advantage of the lack of size that the Heat had out on the basketball floor. Roy Hibbert was a double double machine, David West was unstoppable in the post, and George Hill along with Lance Stephenson provided the complimentary contributions. 

 

Lets debunk this myth: 'Paul George is the only player to challenge Lebron in the East in the last 7 years'. 

 

Okay, you ready?

Out of those 3 years of Pacers relevancy, Paul George was the best player on his team only one time versus the Heat. The other 2 outings his teammates did most of the heavy lifting, and he was completely outclassed by Lebron also. This year he got swept by The king and had a rather pedestrian closeout game on his home floor.

 

1 time out of the last 7 years has Paul George been the best player on his team AND posed a challenge to Lebron. 1 time. But even then, we can't ignore the impact that David West (16 points, 7 rebounds) and Lance Stephenson (14 points, 6 rebounds, 5 assists per game) had on that 'one' series.

 

The Pacers success was due to a collective effort, not just one particular player. 

 

But is that the 'only' time Lebron has gotten challenged in the east - from the Pacers? I think not.. 

 

In 2012 the Celtics took James to game 7. In 2015 the Bulls lost a dog fight in 6. In 2016 the Raptors stole 2 games. That 2012-2014 Indiana Pacers team may be Lebron's toughest postseason foe outside of the finals, but their success was largely due to their size, strength and cohesion, rather than one individual.

 

PG is a scorer and no one is going to stop him from doing so - as evident in this post season. However, he also isn't the type who will win you many games even with a decent roster and depth - as evident in this past season. And no, he wasn't the only player to challenge Lebron in the past 7 years. In fact, an argument could be made that his former teammate - David West - posed more of a roadblock towards Lebron's return at a finals than he himself did.";
