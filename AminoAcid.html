				<h3><span class="mma">Entry 1:</span> Feeling Bad for Bethe?
					<br />6/18/2017</h3>
						<p id='text1'>I don't feel bad, but she is hated beyond what is necessary. <br /><br />


						She is obviously not the greatest of fighters, nor athletes, we all know that. She trash talks for the same reason that many others trash talk - to sell the fight. It shouldn't be a reason to hate, especially when you know that behind the scenes she's not that person, as evident by the sauna picture. This isn't Ronda, Bethe is actually a respectable individual out of the octagon. <br /><br />

						Her face has become a huge target of attack. Had it not been for her stunning body she most likely wouldn't recieve that heat. <br /><br />


						It doesn't really matter though, I mean, it's sherdog afterall.
