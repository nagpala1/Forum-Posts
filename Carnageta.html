				<h3><span>Entry 1:</span> Debunking The Paul George Myth
					<br />6/21/2017</h3>
						<p id='text1'>Jimmy Butler has challenged Lebron plenty. Lets not forget that the Chicago Bulls were a mere 2 seconds away from bolstering a 3-1 advantage over Cleveland in the 2015 postseason before James hit the game winning 3 on the road. Paul George is a great player, but in what way did he 'challenge' Lebron this year other than having 3 great scoring outbursts in the playoffs? After all, his team got swept and actually managed to blow a 25 point lead in one of those games. <br /><br />

						The Pacers posed a challenge to Miami in 2012, 2013 and 2014, but that wasn't just because of the mighty, barely 6th best small-forward in the league. It was more-so because of the overall team effort of Indiana as opposed to one particular individual. The Pacers were a big and physical bunch and took advantage of the lack of size that the Heat had out on the basketball floor. Roy Hibbert was a double double machine, David West was unstoppable in the post, and George Hill along with Lance Stephenson provided the complimentary contributions. <br /><br />

						Lets debunk this myth: "Paul George is the only player to challenge Lebron in the East in the last 7 years". <br /><br />

						Okay, you ready? <br /><br /><br />


						2012 - Pacers vs. Heat playoffs (Heat win in 6):<br /><br />

						Paul George: 10 points, 6 rebounds, 2 assists per game. (DRtg: 101, ORtg: 101, GameScore: 8.7)<br /><br />

						David West: 15 points, 8 rebounds, 2 assists per game. (107, 111, 10.5)<br /><br />

						Danny Granger: 13 points, 4.5 rebounds, 3 assists per game. (107, 97, 7.3)<br /><br />

						Lebron James: 30 points, 11 rebounds, 6 assists per game. (106, 121, 23.4)<br /><br />

						(2 other Pacers scored in double figure this series - George Hill @ 13ppg and Roy Hibbert at 12ppg to go along with 12rbpg.<br /><br /><br />


						2013 - Pacers vs. Heat playoffs (Heat win in 7):<br /><br />

						Paul George: 19.5 points, 6 rebounds, 5 assists per game. (DRtg: 112, ORtg: 106, GameScore: 11.9)<br /><br />

						David West: 16.6 points, 9 rebounds, 2 assists per game. (111, 103, 11.2)<br /><br />

						Roy Hibbert: 22 points, 10 rebounds per game. (112, 123, 16.9)<br /><br />

						Lebron James: 29 points, 7 rebounds, 5 assists per game. (106, 121, 23.4)<br /><br /><br />

 
						2014 - Pacers vs. Heat playoffs (Heat win in 6):<br /><br />

						Paul George: 24 points, 5 rebounds, 4 assists per game. (DRtg: 115, ORtg: 114, GameScore: 16.8)<br /><br />

						David West: 16 points, 7 rebounds, 3 assists per game. (117, 110, 11.7)<br /><br />

						Lance Stephenson: 14 points, 6 rebounds, 5 assists per game. (118, 114, 11.3)<br /><br />

						Lebron James: 23 points, 6 rebounds, 5.5 assists per game. (106, 118, 19)<br /><br /><br />


						Out of those 3 years of Pacers relevancy, Paul George was the best player on his team only one time versus the Heat. The other 2 outings his teammates did most of the heavy lifting, and he was completely outclassed by Lebron also. This year he got swept by The king and had a rather pedestrian closeout game on his home floor.<br /><br />

						1 time out of the last 7 years has Paul George been the best player on his team AND posed a challenge to Lebron. 1 time. But even then, we can't ignore the impact that David West (16 points, 7 rebounds) and Lance Stephenson (14 points, 6 rebounds, 5 assists per game) had on that 'one' series.<br /><br />

						The Pacers success was due to a collective effort, not just one particular player.<br /><br />

						But is that the 'only' time Lebron has gotten challenged in the east - from the Pacers? I think not.. <br /><br />

						In 2012 the Celtics took James to game 7. In 2015 the Bulls lost a dog fight in 6. In 2016 the Raptors stole 2 games. That 2012-2014 Indiana Pacers team may be Lebron's toughest postseason foe outside of the finals, but their success was largely due to their size, strength and cohesion, rather than just one individual.<br /><br />

						PG is a star and no one is going to stop him from doing what he does best - score. However, he isn't the type of player who will win you many games. Even with a decent roster and depth, George only managed to lead the Pacers to 42 wins this past season. And no, he wasn't the only player to challenge Lebron in the past 7 years. In fact, an argument could be made that his former teammate - David West - posed more of a roadblock towards Lebron's return at a finals than he himself did. <br /><br />

				<h3><span>Entry 2:</span> The Johnson Brothers
					<br />6/20/2017</h3>
						<p>
							Fun fact: Only 2 bench players this season averaged at least 12 points, 3 assists and 3 rebounds per game. Both of those players were members of the Miami Heat (James Johnson and Tyler Johnson). <br /><br />
							As I mentioned several days ago, the Johnson brothers aren't just great all-around basketball players, but they are also elite defenders as the defensive metrics place them in the top 5 at their respective positions. <br /><br />

							Lets not forget, Tyler Johnson has yet to play 140 NBA games. 19 mill is a fairly high amount but unless we're packaging him away for a star in return - or a high draft pick - he shouldn't be traded. Not yet at least. <br /><br />

							TJ has all of the characteristics of a true Heat player. Guys like him don't always come around..

				<h3><span>Entry 3:</span> Miami Heat Free Agency
					<br />6/24/2017</h3>
						<p>
							The more I think about it, the more I'm leaning towards resigning Waiters and Johnson, and adding another solid complimentary player to the roster as opposed to throwing the bank at Gordon Hayward and in turn, only being able to keep one of those other individuals (at best).<br/><br/>

 

							In all honestly, I believe it will cost us a little more than we're expecting to resign both Waiters and JJ, considering they will be receiving substantial offers from other teams. We will get a discount, but only if we come somewhat close to what their highest offers are. These guys love Miami, but they haven't been paid big yet so money will speak the highest volumes.<br/><br/>

 

							Realistically, I think it will take around 12-13 mill (at the minimum) to retain Dion and probably close to that same value for JJ as well. If we're able to shed the McRibs contract, that would leave us with about 15 mil to add another impact player (or two). <br/><br/>

 

							I want Rudy Gay as I believe he'll be able to thrive in Miami - considering he's healthy. I want to retain Ellie as well, but with about 15 mil left we most likely can't sign both of them. Rudy is going to receive some big deals this summer, it might just cost us the rest of the remaining cap space to reel him in.<br/><br/>

 

							Iguodala would be nice addition as well, but if he's really willing to leave Golden State - a team that's in the running to win many more championships - it is most likely going to be for a 'bigger' pay day.

				<h3><span>Entry 4:</span> Underrated Rudy Gay
					<br />6/12/2017</h3>
						<p>
							I agree that his injury is a concern. It's the only concern I have with him right now. <br/><br/>

 

							JJ was a vital part of our system this past season and I definitely would like to keep him as well if it's possible. That being said, he is not on Gay's level..<br/><br/>

 

							Offensively, it's not even a question who's the better player. Rudy's numbers on that side of the end are far superior. You guys have said it yourself, he has been playing with bums for several years in a row now, yet he still consistently puts up 18 per game on mid-40s fg%. If James Johnson, who has never been a good shooter, can come to Miami and shoot a career high 34% from behind-the-arc, who's to say the culture here wouldn't also elevate Gay's game? And that's another thing, Johnson shot 34% from downtown which happens to be his career high, while Rudy's average over the course of his career sits at 35%..<br/><br/>

 

							You might say that Rudy was never part of a winning organization, but I'd have to disagree with that statement. Several years ago, he was part of something big in Memphis. In 2011 the Grizzlies won 46 games and finished with the 8th seed in the wild west. 46 wins, 8th seed, you already know that was a stacked conference. Gay had averages of 19.8, 6 and 3 that season to go along with 47% from the field and 40% from 3. <br/><br/>

 

							The following year, which was also the NBA lockout season, those same Grizzlies pulled off 41 wins and finished 4th in the West. Rudy once again, was an integral part to that system, averaging 19, 6.4 and 2.3.<br/><br/>

 

							RG has played 'winning basketball' before. You might believe that James Johnson is currently the superior defensive player and that is true. JJ had a DFS (defensive win shares) of 3.2, a WS (win shares) of 5.1, and a WS/48 (win shares per 48 minutes) of .117 over the course of the 2016-2017 NBA season. Those numbers triumph Gay's, who has spent the past several years in Sacramento. However, lets take a look at what Rudy was able to accomplish when he was with a winning team..<br/><br/>

 

							Remember, the Heat won 41 games this past season, and the 2011-2012 Memphis Grizzlies also won 41 (so the sample size isn't affected because one team had more wins). RG during that year with the Grizzlies had a DFS of 3.3, a WS of 6, and a WS/48 of .120. So when people say that Gay has never played winning basketball before, it is simply false. He was a part of something big in Memphis, and he was also part of the reason as to why that Grizzlies team had one of the best defenses in the NBA.<br/><br/>

 

							Given all of this, I really don't see how Rudy wouldn't be able to elevate his game in Miami, the way he did a couple seasons ago in Memphis, and the way JJ currently did this past season. Offensively, it's not even close. Defensively, JJ might be the better player currently. However, all of the data is there to support the argument that Gay can be just as good on that side of the floor if he is to play in a defensively oriented organization, such as the Heat.<br/><br/>

 

							His injury is a concern, so Riley should definitely proceed with caution. But when the two are healthy, it's not even close.
